# Gods-Choice Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
**gods-choice** is a decision-making hint system that helps users find answers for uncertain situations. The project tagline: "God always knows the right one."

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Early-stage project initialization
- **Primary Focus**: Establish project structure and define core architecture
- **Key Files**: [README.md](../../README.md), [.gitignore](../../.gitignore)

## Core Architecture (To Be Developed)
This project will likely implement:
- **Decision Engine**: Logic to analyze user questions and generate helpful hints
- **Data Layer**: Storage for decision rules, hints, and user feedback
- **Interface**: User-facing system to query the hint system

## Development Workflow
### Initial Setup
1. Establish project type (Node.js, Python, etc.) based on requirements
2. Set up build system, testing framework, and linting standards
3. Create folder structure following project conventions once established

### Expected Structure (Propose Before Building)
- `/src` - Source code
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `.github/workflows` - CI/CD pipelines

## Key Patterns to Establish
- **Request/Response Flow**: How hints are requested and delivered
- **Extensibility**: Adding new decision rules or hint sources
- **Validation**: User input validation and edge case handling
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback when hints cannot be determined

## AI Agent Guidance
When contributing to this project:
1. **Ask before major architectural decisions** - This is early-stage, so proposing structure is valuable
2. **Document reasons** for structural choices in commit messages
3. **Reference the vision** of helping users make decisions through hints
4. **Keep designs simple** until requirements necessitate complexity
5. **Test-first approach** for core decision logic to ensure reliability

## Integration Points (Planned)
- User query input validation
- Hint generation/lookup mechanisms
- Feedback loop for hint accuracy
- Potential future: API endpoints, UI frameworks, data persistence

## Important Notes
- No existing code conventions yet; establish clear patterns early
- `.gitignore` configured for Node.js/npm projects (likely technology stack)
- Focus on clarity and maintainability given early project stage
